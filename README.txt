GradeGrub is a browser extension designed to make Edline more useful and less stupid. Check out the project page at https://sites.google.com/site/themegapodeworks/home/gradegrub for a few more details on how it works.

If you'd like to work on GradeGrub, you can find some information on developing Google Chrome extensions at http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/devguide.html.

Instructions for installing the unpacked extension files:
1. Clone the repository
2. In Chrome, go to Tools->Extensions and check "Developer mode." Click "Load unpacked extension" and select the "gradegrub_ext" directory.

If you do want to contribute to GradeGrub, the extension you pack will ONLY update correctly if you have access to the original keyfile used to sign it. Contact me at tjweisman@gmail.com if you're interested in fixing/adding to GradeGrub.
